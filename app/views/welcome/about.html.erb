<h1>About SnapBlast</h1>

<p>
    <a href="http://www.teamsnap.com/">TeamSnap</a> offers features for
    sending emails and SMS messages, but not voice calls.  That's where
    SnapBlast comes in.  It allows a coach/manager to quickly call the
    entire team in one blast with a voice message.  For when you need to
    get word out in a hurry.
